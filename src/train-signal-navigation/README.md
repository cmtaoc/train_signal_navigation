# Train signal station

Through the controller, a site can request up to 10 different materials, and complete multiple goods distribution with large warehouses.
If your factory formula is very complex, the module is extremely useful.

## Usage

- **Set supply station:** Just change the station name to "Material"+"specific name", and "specific name" can be changed in the settings, default "Supply".
If you have multiple supply stations, just add some numbers.
- **Special line train:** Assign a dedicated train to the supply station. The schedule likes: "Material"Supply > "Material".
When you set the schedule, there may be no "Material" station, you need to create a "material" station, set the schedule and then destroy it.
- **Automatic allocation:** Luckily you don't have to set the train schedule, when you create a train with carriages, it will set the schedule to a supply station without trains.
- **Controller use:** Place the controller near the "Material" station and set request material, connect the warehouse with the green line, the red line may be useful in the future.
- Material lower limit: Change the station name when the material inventory is lower than the lower limit, and output the request signal.
- Material upper limit: The red signal is output when the material inventory reaches the upper limit.
